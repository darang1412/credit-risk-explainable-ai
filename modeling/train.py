"""
Phase 5 - Model Training & Experimentation, tracked in MLflow.

Trains two models on the Phase 4 feature table and compares them honestly on
a held-out validation split:

  - Logistic regression: an interpretable baseline. Its coefficients can be
    read directly ("for a one-unit increase in this feature, the log-odds of
    default change by X"), which is a useful sanity check independent of
    SHAP (Phase 7).
  - LightGBM: the primary candidate, chosen over a neural network because
    gradient-boosted trees are the established strong default for
    well-engineered tabular data at this scale (see the roadmap's Phase 1
    note on why this project skips deep-learning theory entirely), and
    because it handles missing values and categorical columns natively -
    which this dataset has a lot of.

Both models use class weighting, not resampling, to handle the ~8%/92% class
imbalance confirmed in Phase 3's EDA: it reweights the training loss so a
mistake on the minority (default) class counts proportionally more, using
every real row instead of discarding majority-class examples the way
downsampling would.
