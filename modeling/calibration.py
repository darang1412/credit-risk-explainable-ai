Phase 6 - Model Calibration.

AUC (Phase 5) only measures whether the model RANKS applicants correctly -
riskier ones score higher. It says nothing about whether "72% predicted
probability" corresponds to an actual 72% observed default rate, which is
what any real use of the number (a business cutoff, an expected-loss
estimate) actually needs.

This is expected to matter a lot here specifically, not just in theory:
Phase 5's LightGBM used scale_pos_weight (~11.4) to fix the class-imbalance
ranking problem, which works by making the training loss treat a missed
default as ~11x more costly. That deliberately distorts the model away from
predicting the true base rate - so the raw probabilities coming out of that
model are expected to be systematically miscalibrated as a direct, known
side effect of the Phase 5 choice, not a separate flaw. This script measures
that distortion and corrects it with isotonic regression.
