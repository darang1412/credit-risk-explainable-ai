Phase 4 - Feature Engineering.

Turns the four raw Home Credit tables into a single feature table, one row per
applicant, keyed on SK_ID_CURR. The core technique throughout is the same one
described in the roadmap's Phase 4 resources: group each auxiliary table by
SK_ID_CURR and aggregate (count/mean/max/sum) its many rows-per-applicant down
to a handful of summary columns, then join those onto application_train.

This also bakes in the concrete action items from the Phase 3 EDA
(pipeline/eda.ipynb) rather than leaving them as loose notes:
  - DAYS_EMPLOYED's 365243 sentinel -> NaN + IS_DAYS_EMPLOYED_ANOMALY flag
  - HAS_BUREAU_HISTORY flag (missingness itself is informative here)
  - CREDIT/INCOME-style ratios instead of relying on raw income/credit alone

Deliberately targets ~50 engineered features (see the roadmap's Phase 4 note:
"don't chase all 10,000+ features some competition solutions built"), not an
exhaustive aggregation of every column in every table.
