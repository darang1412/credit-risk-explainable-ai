Phase 7 - Explainability with SHAP.

Two views of the same underlying question - "why does the model think this
applicant is risky?" - answered with Shapley values rather than an ad hoc
importance heuristic:

  - GLOBAL: which features matter most across the whole validation set
    (a beeswarm/summary plot). This is checked against the hypotheses
    written down in Phase 3's EDA (pipeline/eda.ipynb), before any model
    existed - agreement is a sanity check, disagreement is worth explaining,
    not silently accepting.
  - LOCAL: for individual high-risk applicants, which specific features
    pushed THIS prediction toward default, and by how much. The top-3 such
    factors per high-risk applicant are saved to disk for Phase 8's Adverse
    Action generator to retrieve regulatory/policy text against.

TreeExplainer is used (not the generic, model-agnostic SHAP explainer)
because it is exact and fast specifically for tree ensembles like LightGBM -
it walks the actual tree structure to compute contributions, rather than
approximating them by sampling feature subsets.

IMPORTANT SEAM BETWEEN PHASE 6 AND PHASE 7: SHAP explains the raw LightGBM
model's output (log-odds / margin space), not the isotonic-calibrated
probability from Phase 6. Isotonic calibration is a separate, non-parametric
step function wrapped AROUND the tree model's output - it has no tree
structure for TreeExplainer to attach to. So these explanations answer "why
did the tree model score this applicant as risky," and calibration is a
separate step afterward that only rescales the resulting probability,
without changing which features drove the decision.
